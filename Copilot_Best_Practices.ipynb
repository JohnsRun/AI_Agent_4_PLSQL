    "## #1 Best use case \n",
    "### 1. Requirements Alignment\n",
    "- Structure Jira user stories with clear business context, rules, and boundary conditions before requesting code generation\n",
    "- Guide Copilot with well-defined requirements to avoid assumption-based code\n",
    "- Ensure specifications are explicit and measurable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Context Management\n",
    "- Keep packages, specifications, and related database schemas in the same workspace\n",
    "- Leverage Enterprise's repository-level context capabilities for comprehensive code understanding\n",
    "- Maintain organized folder structure for easy reference\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Security & Compliance\n",
    "- Explicitly prohibit generation of production credentials or customer data examples\n",
    "- Require manual review of critical financial logic before deployment\n",
    "- Implement strict access controls for sensitive insurance data\n",
    "- Create compliance documentation for all generated code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Progressive Code Generation\n",
    "- For complex Oracle packages and TrueComp logic, use function-level and step-level prompts\n",
    "- Avoid requesting entire modules in a single prompt\n",
    "- Build incrementally with validation at each step\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Knowledge Management (Indexing)\n",
    "- **Index Internal Documentation**: Use the Knowledge Bases feature to index:\n",
    "- Confluence pages and architecture decision records (ADRs)\n",
    "- Insurance-specific domain logic (claims processing, underwriting rules)\n",
    "- Company standards and best practices\n",
    "- **Repository Indexing**: Index \"Golden Path\" repositories to ensure Copilot suggests internal standards rather than generic patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Legacy Modernization & Maintenance\n",
    "- **Code Explanation**: Use Copilot to translate and explain legacy COBOL or older Java/Mainframe logic\n",
    "- **Documentation Generation**: Generate docstrings and READMEs for undocumented legacy modules to improve maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Case:**\n",
    "    get_date\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Quality & Compliance (Testing)\n",
    "- **Regression Testing**: Generate exhaustive unit tests and edge-case scenarios for calculation engines\n",
    "- **Automated PR Summaries**: Create human-readable audit trails for compliance review and approval\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Prompt Engineering for Insurance Domain\n",
    "- Provide context about specific insurance products (Life, P&C, Health) in prompts\n",
    "- **Example - Poor**: \"Calculate premium.\"\n",
    "- **Example - Good**: \"Calculate the monthly premium for a Term Life policy based on the actuarial tables in /docs/actuarial-v2.md.\"\n",
